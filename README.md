# Amazon Clone

A simple front-end clone of Amazonâ€™s homepage built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and basic **JavaScript**.  
This was one of my early projects in 2022 to practice layout design, styling, and simple interactivity.

## Features
- Amazon-like header, product grid, and footer  
- Basic CSS styling and responsiveness  
- Simple JavaScript for small interactive elements  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Open `index.html` in any browser
